Hello, my name is Jack Lin! I am a senior in Computer Science and commute to school everyday from a small town called 
Dover Plains, it is about an hour away from campus. I have an interest in economics, videogames, and coding! 
I have no minors, but I have taken the following courses all at New Paltz: Computer Science I / II, 
Assembly Language & Computer Architecture, Computer Algorithms, Discrete Math, and Digital Logic. 

I have roughly two years of experience with Java, with 8 months of experience with C / C++. I also have experience with 
JavaScript, XML, CSS, and Python from personal projects. I have accomplished 3 projects relating to C language and Assembly 
with the Assembly Language & Computer Architecture course. I have also personally completed a full project on a 
visualizer to show algorithmic sorting using JavaScript, XML and CSS.

I hope to learn way more about the backend of creating a website, as I have most of my experience being 
on the front end of projects rather than backend. I also hope to learn more about effective ways to implement 
experimental functions or applications to my project throughout the semester.
